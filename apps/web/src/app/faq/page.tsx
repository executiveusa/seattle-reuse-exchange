  // Bidding
  {
    topic: 'Bidding',
    question: 'How does bidding work?',
    answer: 'Place your bid on any active auction. If someone outbids you, you\'ll be notified. Auctions have anti-sniping protection - if a bid is placed in the last 60 seconds, the auction extends by another 60 seconds to ensure fair bidding.'
  },
  {
    topic: 'Bidding',
    question: 'Can I cancel a bid?',
    answer: 'You have 10 minutes after placing a bid to cancel it if it was placed accidentally. After that, bids are binding to ensure fairness to other bidders. Contact us immediately if you have concerns about a bid.'
  },
  {
    topic: 'Bidding',
    question: 'What happens if I win an auction?',

    question: 'What is the commission rate?',

    question: 'Can I set a reserve price for my items?',
